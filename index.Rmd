## Introduction

Welcome to my website! My name is Binyam Yilma, and I'm currently a 2nd year student at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. My study focus is on Biostatistics within Public Health, and Comparative Effectiveness and Outcomes Research.


I love running, cooking, watching good films, chocolate, jazz and **Data Science**! 


This is me!
